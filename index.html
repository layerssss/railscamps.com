<p class="placeholder">Ruby Retreats (the events formerly known as Rails Camps) are regular fixtures in Australia, New Zealand and the USA, and have also occurred at times in the UK, Denmark and Poland. It would be awesome to see more happen elsewhere. Ruby Retreats happen because people make them happen. People like you.</p>
